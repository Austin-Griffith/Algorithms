most optimal/near optimal output for spear & men assignments

Do you expect us to have an explict greedy Solution for #3
	- my algo produces a near optimal solution without computing all possible combo's hence the instructionin the pdf 
	- what justification is expected for a neal optimal solution to recieve full credit? 







Exam Problem 5 loop invarient 

"""
loop invariant 1: pplHit[a][b] = True if person b was splashed by a for all a < i else False

	initialization:
		pplHit is initialized to a list of all False -- there is no a < 0, b < 0 so there is no True
	maintenance:

		((loop invariant 2: pplDistance[i][minDistAt] is the minimum of all pplDistance[i][b] for b < j
			
			initialization: minDistAt = 0 representing our belief that person 0 is being splashed by person i -- b = 0 < j = 1
			maintenance:  minDistAt = index of min distance between person i for all people m for 0 ≤ m ≤ j 
			termination: j = length of the matrix @ i 
		))

		we find the minimum pplDistance[i][b] for 0 ≤ b < len( pplDistance )
			then b must be the person that i splashes
			so we update pplHit accordingly

		now the loop invariant holds for all a ≤ i 


	termination:
		i = len( pplDistance ), so we know that the invariant holds for all a < len( pplDistance ),
			that is, each person has splashed exactly one person, represented by pplHit
